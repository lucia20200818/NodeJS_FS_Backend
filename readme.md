# README

Welcome to the backend project for my bookstore website! This project powers the server-side logic and database interactions necessary for a fully functional online bookstore. It supports features like membership registration, login, a home page, author search, and a comprehensive book catalog. Below, you'll find detailed information about the technologies used to build this backend, the features it supports, and how to get started.

## Technologies Used

### HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create API documentation and testing templates within Postman. While HTML is primarily a frontend technology, it plays a role in this backend project by providing a structured format for presenting and testing API endpoints.

### JavaScript
JavaScript is the primary programming language used to build the server-side logic of the application. Leveraging Node.js, JavaScript allows for scalable and efficient handling of server requests, responses, and middleware operations. It ensures smooth and responsive interactions between the frontend and backend.

### MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL database used to store all the data for the bookstore. It provides a flexible schema design, allowing for easy storage and retrieval of complex data structures. MongoDB's powerful querying capabilities ensure efficient handling of user data, book information, and author profiles.

### Postman
Postman is a powerful tool for API development and testing. It is used to create, test, and document the API endpoints of the bookstore. Postman helps ensure that all endpoints are working correctly and efficiently, providing a user-friendly interface for making HTTP requests and viewing responses.

### Jest
Jest is a testing framework used to ensure the reliability and correctness of the backend code. It is employed to write and run unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Jest's robust testing capabilities help maintain high code quality and prevent regressions, ensuring that all features work as expected.

## Features

### Membership Registration and Login
The membership registration and login features allow users to create accounts and access personalized services. The backend handles user authentication, storing hashed passwords in MongoDB for security. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for session management, ensuring secure and stateless authentication.

### Home Page
The home page provides an overview of the latest arrivals, popular books, and featured authors. The backend fetches and aggregates this data from the database, ensuring that the frontend displays up-to-date information. This feature involves multiple API endpoints that retrieve various data sets efficiently.

### Author Search
The author search feature allows users to search for their favorite authors and view detailed profiles. The backend handles search queries, fetching matching author data from MongoDB and returning it to the frontend. This feature includes optimized search algorithms to ensure quick and accurate results.

### Book Catalog
The book catalog is a comprehensive listing of all books available in the bookstore. The backend manages CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for book data, ensuring that users can browse, filter, and view detailed information about each book. API endpoints are designed to handle large datasets efficiently, providing paginated responses where necessary.

## Getting Started

   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
   ```sh
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. **Run the Server:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

5. **Run Tests:**
   ```sh
   npm test
   ```

## Conclusion

This backend project for the bookstore website is designed to provide a robust and efficient server-side solution. By leveraging technologies like HTML for documentation, JavaScript for server logic, MongoDB for data storage, Postman for API testing, and Jest for comprehensive testing, the project ensures a high-quality and reliable backend.
